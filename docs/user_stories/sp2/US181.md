# 1. Requirements

>__"As a family member, I want to register a payment that I have made using one of my cash accounts."__

## 1.1 Description
**Demo1** As a family member, I want to select the cash account in which I want to add a payment registration
- Demo1.1. select the cash account in which I want to add the payment registration.
- Demo1.2. if the account selected isn't a cash account, the requirement cannot be fulfilled.  

**Demo2** As a family member, I want to register a payment using one of my cash accounts.
- Demo2.1. select the cash account and add the payment registration.
- Demo2.2. if the person doesn't have a cash account, the requirement cannot be fulfilled.  
- Demo2.3. if the payment input data are wrong, the requirement cannot be fulfilled.

The requirement of this US focuses on the registration of one payment made through a person's cash account. To fulfill 
this purpose, the family member must select the cash account and  introduce the correct data to make registration. 
This registration is saved in the person's cash account, therefore, the family member must have an account created and 
assigned. Otherwise, the requirement isn't successfully crafted.

# 2. Analysis

## 2.1 Product Owner 
During the Sprint, the product owner (PO) set some specifications that contribute to the design and implementation of 
the US.

> Q: Which data should be presented in the movement registration on the Cash Account ?
- Each movement contains its description, the category, the date of the payment, amount of money involved, and the 
balance of the cash account after the payment.

> Q: Can the family member have more than one cash account? 
- For now, each family member has one personal cash account.

## 2.2 Decisions
-The major decision made in this US was to save all the movements in each root account.

## 2.3 Dependent US
To deliver this US, it is required that the family member has one cash account, which references to the US170.

In this US, the fist step consists on the family member choosing the account in which the person wants to register the 
payment. In this case, all of its accounts are presented, like bank accounts, savings accounts,... and he must choose the 
cashaccount. This list of accounts are saved in the account service. In order to the AddPaymentRegistrationController 
to provide the list of the person's account, all the accounts on the service are checked and all the ones that have the
person ID as its attribute are presented to the person account list as a DTO.
After that, the person selects the cash account in which the payment is going to be added, and introduces the data 
required to add the movement registration. The necessary input data are: the family ID, the account ID, the amount of 
the payment,  the category in which is the movement is included, the description and the date.
The category involved in this process is introduced as a CategoryDTO, and it's tranformed into a Category Object 
within the Business Domain. This category provided must exist in the family list of categories,whether the category ID 
represents a standard category, or represents a customized category (both saved in the family attributes information).
If the Category doesn't exist in the family data, the movement isn't created, and the process stops. For that, the
Account Service, which goes to the Family Service, finds the family and checks the category.

end

```
The final process is to create and add the movement in the cash account. The first part is to transform the input amount
in a MoneyValue object, since this amount represents money, which is a class that must obey some rules. The next step is
to remove the money from the cash amount in the person's cash account. This is the most important part of the process, since
it is the one that validates the achievement of this US. If the amount is negative or less than the amount that the 
cash account has at that moment, the requirement isn't fulfilled. If this process is successful, the movement is 
created and register in the person's cash account.

As demonstrated in the Class Diagram, a Controller class makes the connection between the UI and the business logic, and
the FFMApplication establishes the connection with the Family Service, which stores each Family, and the Account Service.
All the accounts are saved in the Account Service. Each Cash Account keeps a Root Account where each of the movements are 
saved. To add a movement to the account, it is necessary to add all the necessary attributes, which must be validated.

# 4. Implementation
*As demonstrated in de "Main Sequence Diagram", the first part of this US is to acquire the list of all the different 
accounts that belong to a certain person. The list is showed as a DTO object. The approach to best implement the 
detailed process in the  "List of all the person's Account" Sequence Diagram was:*

    /**
     * Returns a list of all the Accounts of a given person
     *
     * @param personId - person id
     * @return list of all the Accounts of a given person
     */
    public List<AccountDTO> getListOfPersonAccounts(String personId) {
        List<AccountDTO> listOfPersonAccount = new ArrayList<>();
        for (Account account : accounts) {
            if (account.isMyAccount(personId)) {
                AccountDTO accountDTO = account.createDTO();
                listOfPersonAccount.add(accountDTO);
            }
        }
        return listOfPersonAccount;
    }
    
*As described by the method above, for each of the accounts present in the Account Service, it is verified if the 
person's ID matches with the person ID in each account. If it is equal, it is added to the list and then returned as 
a DTO object.

*In the second part of the US, the Family Member selects the cash account in which he wants to add the payment 
registration. This process is described by the method above.*
     
     /**
         * Add payment Registration
         *
         * @param amount      - payment amount
         * @param categoryID  - category ID
         * @param description - payment description
         * @return Returns true if movement is correctly added.
         */
        public boolean addPaymentRegistration(String familyID, String accountID, double amount,
                                              String categoryID, String description, String date) {
    
            Family family = familyService.findFamily(familyID);
    
            MoneyValue money = new MoneyValue(new BigDecimal(amount));
            Account cashAccount = obtainAccount(accountID);
            boolean result = false;
            if (cashAccount.isCashAccount()) {
                try {
                    Category category = family.getCategory(categoryID);
                    cashAccount.withdraw(money);
                    cashAccount.addMovementRegistration(money.toNegative(), category, description, date);
                    result = true;
                } catch (IllegalArgumentException | NoSuchElementException exception) {
                    result = false;
                }
            }
            return result;
    
        }

*The first part of the method is to validate the familyID in the input data. With this variable, it is possible to find the
family register in the application and access to its category list (customize or standard). If the category ID matches 
a family category, the payment amount is withdrawn from the person's cash account, and a movement is created, and added to 
the person cash account list of movements. In this process is created a MoneyValue object which correspondes to 
the object that represents the money variable.
If the Category isn't valid or if the person's cash account doesn't have enough money to withdraw the payment amount, the
process stops with an error message.*

# 5. Integration/Demo
*The [US170](./US170.md) is, at the moment, one of the dependencies that exists in this US, since it is necessary to
create a person's cash account in which the family member wants to add the payment registration.*
*Another connection is the  [US001](../sp1/US001.md), since it is necessary for a family to have at least one 
category in the family's category list, to register the payment.*

# 6. Observations
*There isn't further relevant information related to this US, at the moment.*
