# US150 - Get Profile Information
=======================================

# 1. Requirements

> __"As a family member, I want to get my profileâ€™s information."__

## 1.1. Description

* Any family member has the possibility to access their profile information, that has their basic information.

**Demo1** The family member wants to see their profile information.

- *Demo 1.1.* The family member is also a family administrator, in that case it will appear in the profile information.

# 2. Analysis

## 2.1.Domain Model in the US context

```puml 
skinparam monochrome true
skinparam sequenceMessageAlign center

skinparam linetype polyline
skinparam linetype ortho
hide empty members
hide circles

skinparam component {
  ArrowFontSize 10
}

title Domain Model Diagram SP03

class Person {
    -Name
    -Birth Date
    -VAT
    -Address
    -Telephone Numbers
    -Main Email
    -Other Emails
}
```

## 2.2.Product Owner

* The product owner requested that the only information visible to the family member is basic information such as the
  name,birth-date, telephone,email,Vat number and address.

## 2.3. US Dependencies

* This User Storie doesn't have other user stories depending on it but has some dependency with [US010](US010.md) (to
  create a family) and [US101](US101.md) (add family members), since it's necessary to have a family first in order to
  add the family members and only then these members are able to see their profile information.

## 2.4. System Sequence Diagram

```puml
skinparam monochrome true
skinparam defaultFontSize 10
autonumber
title SSD
actor "Family Member" as fm

fm-> "System" : ask to see profile information
activate fm
activate "System"
|||  

fm <-- "System" : show profile information

deactivate fm
deactivate "System"

```

# 3. Design

## 3.1. Spring Boot Sequence Diagram in the US context

```puml
skinparam monochrome true
autonumber
skinparam SequenceMessageAlign left
title Bootstrap Sequence Diagram


activate ":Bootstrap"
":Bootstrap" --> "PersonService : personService" : :create(personRepository)
":Bootstrap" --> "PersonRepository :personRepository" : : 
":Bootstrap" --> "ViewInfoProfileController" : :
":Bootstrap" --> "<<Singleton>> Container" : :
":Bootstrap" -> "<<Singleton>> Container" : :set(PersonService)
":Bootstrap" -> "<<Singleton>> Container" : :set(PersonRepository)


```

## 3.2.Class Diagram

```puml

skinparam monochrome true
skinparam linetype ortho
skinparam SequenceMessageAlign left
title Class diagram US150

class "ViewProfileController"
class "Person"
class "PersonService"
class "PersonRepository"

class ViewProfileController {
 
    + getUserProfile(String personId)
}

class PersonService{
    + getUserProfile(personId)
    + findPersonById(email) 
    
}

class Person {
    +getProfile()
}

ViewProfileInfoController -- PersonService
PersonService ..> PersonRepository
PersonRepository "1" *-- "0..*" PersonList : listOfPersons
PersonList "1" *-- "0..*" Person


```

As shown in the diagram there is the class Controller that makes the connection between the UI and the business logic.
The services and repositories are initialized with the Spring Boot framework, that is shown in the *3.1* diagram.

The *Person Service* makes the connection between the *Controller* and the *Person Repository*. And is the *repository*
that has the responsibility to store the list with all the users in the system. Through that list we can access each
user in order to get to their profile information.

## 3.3.Functionalities Flow

```puml
skinparam monochrome true

autonumber
title Get Profile Information
actor "Family Member" as FM
participant ":UI" as UI
participant ":viewProfileInfoController" as VPC
participant "PersonService" as ps
participant "PersonRepository" as rp
participant "Person" as P

FM -> UI: request profile infomation
activate UI
UI -> VPC : getUserProfile(personId)
activate VPC
VPC -> ps :getPersonRepository()
activate ps
VPC <-- rp :personRepository
activate rp
VPC -> ps :getUserProfile(personId)
ps -> rp : findById(email)
deactivate VPC
ps <-- rp : person
deactivate rp

ps -> P :getUserProfile()
activate P

P --> ps : PersonProfile(name,vatNumber,\nphoneNumber,emails,address,\nbirthDate)
deactivate P


ps --> VPC :PersonProfile(name,vatNumber,\nphoneNumber,emails,address,\nbirthDate)
deactivate ps
activate VPC
VPC --> UI :PersonProfile(name,vatNumber,\nphoneNumber,emails,address,\nbirthDate)
deactivate VPC

UI --> FM :PersonProfile(name,vatNumber,\nphoneNumber,emails,address,\nbirthDate)
 deactivate UI  
```

The ViewProfileController will invoke the PersonService, that connects to the PersonRepository, in which is possible to
access all the users(in the list of members) and their personal ID(email).
<p>To be able to access the person's information, we must go through the list of family members, and check to see which one has the same ID as the person who did the request to see the profile information. 
When the ID's are the same, it will be shown the person profile with the following information:</p>

- Name
- Birth Date
- Phone Number(s)
- Email(s)
- VAT number
- Address

## 3.4. Applied Design Patterns

From GRASP pattern:

Controller: Is responsible for handling all system events of a use case, delegates the work that needs to be done to
other objects.

Information Expert: Assigns responsibility to the class that has the information needed to fulfill it.

## 3.5. Tests

**Test 1:** Get family member profile: success

    @Test
    @DisplayName("Get user profile : success")
    void getUserProfileSuccess() throws InvalidDateException, InvalidEmailException, InvalidVATException, InvalidPersonNameException {
        //arrange
        UUID familyid = UUID.randomUUID();
        FamilyID familyID = new FamilyID(familyid);
        TelephoneNumber telephones = new TelephoneNumber("225658541");
        Address address = new Address("Rua Nova","25","4125-886", "Porto", "Portugal");
        BirthDate birthDate = new BirthDate("22/01/1995");
        ID id = new Email("email@gmail.com");
        PersonName name = new PersonName("Constantino");
        VAT vat = new VAT("123456789");
        TelephoneNumberList telephoneNumberList = new TelephoneNumberList();
        telephoneNumberList.add(telephones);
        //act
        Person person = new PersonBuilder(id)
                .withAddress(address)
                .withBirthDate(birthDate)
                .withName(name)
                .withTelephoneNumbers(telephoneNumberList)
                .withVat(vat)
                .withFamilyID(familyID)
                .build();
        Map<String, String> profile = person.getProfile();
        //assert
        assertNotNull(profile);
    }

**Test 2:** Get family member profile: failure

    @Test
    @DisplayName("Get user profile : no person found")
    void getUserProfileFailure() throws InvalidDateException, InvalidEmailException, InvalidVATException, InvalidPersonNameException {
      //arrange
      PersonRepository repository = new PersonRepository();
      PersonService personService = new PersonService(repository);
      UUID familyid = UUID.randomUUID();
      FamilyID familyID = new FamilyID(familyid);
      TelephoneNumber telephones = new TelephoneNumber("225658541");
      Address address = new Address("Rua Nova","25","4125-886", "Porto", "Portugal");
      BirthDate birthDate = new BirthDate("22/01/1995");
      Email id = new Email("email@gmail.com");
      PersonName name = new PersonName("Name");
      VAT vat = new VAT("123456789");
      TelephoneNumberList telephoneNumberList = new TelephoneNumberList();
      telephoneNumberList.add(telephones);
      //act
      Person person = new PersonBuilder(id)
             .withAddress(address)
             .withBirthDate(birthDate)
             .withName(name)
             .withTelephoneNumbers(telephoneNumberList)
             .withVat(vat)
             .withFamilyID(familyID)
             .build();
      //assert
        assertThrows(Exception.class, ()-> personService.getUserProfile("noname@gmail.com"));
    }

# 4. Implementation

* The implementation of this US, was quite simple because of the user stories that were implemented before, such as
  creating a family and adding a family member.
  
# 5. Integration/Demo

* Given the implementation of [US001](US010.md) and [US001](US101.md), it wasn't necessary to implement more methods.
