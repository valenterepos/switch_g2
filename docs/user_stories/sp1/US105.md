# 1. Requirements

>__"As a family administrator, I want to create a relation between two family members."__

## 1.1 Description
The family administrator has the possibility to select two members of the family, that he is part of, and create a relation between them.
The selected members cannot be the same person and don't need to include the administrator. That give us a more flexible functionality by maintaining the possibility of a broader range of connections if necessary. 

**Demo1** As family administrator, I want to select two members that I want to relate
- Demo1.1. if a family as less than two members, I cannot go further with this function. 
- Demo1.2. a list of family members is displayed to me, and I select two members.

**Demo2** As family administrator, I want to choose the type of relation between those members
- Demo2.1. I choose a type of relation that connects the two members. 

We interpreted this requirement as a direct possibility of the family administrator to connect any member of the family to another member through a family relation.

## 2.2 Product Owner 
Some answers of the product owner (PO) are important in some design decisions.
> The definition of a relation isn't done at the creation of a member of the family. 
>
- That means that at anytime the family administrator has the power to define it.

> Q: As a family administrator, I want to get a list of family members and the relation that they have with me. A: It's possible, but it would mean to translate existing relations to relations with the family administrator.
>
> Q: As family administrator, I want to get a list of family members and all possible relations between them. A: There are a lot of possible combinations. That functionality seem useless.
>
- The greatest question here hangs upon the possibility of just being necessary a relation between a member and his family administrator.
If we interpret the last answer as to display all relations as something useless. It would mean that the US105 wants to let the administrator create a relation between any two members. This interpretation is supported by the second answer.

## 2.3 Decisions

- The family relation are stores in a list inside the Family class.

- The FamilyRelation instance has three attributes: a person ID, a kin ID and a relation type that connects the two members. 
  To avoid the creation of a symmetric family relation, i.e. person is parent of kin and kin is child of person, the relationType attribute will have a method to return its opposite value.
  That bind us to a special override of the equals() method: two instances of FamilyRelation are the same if personID == other.personID && kinID == other.kinID || personID == other.kinID && kinID == other.personID.
  
- When creating and adding a new FamilyRelation, we need first see if this family relation was already defined, using the above mentioned equals() method.
If true, we delete this FamilyRelation instance and create a new one. If it returns false, we just create a new instance.
The function can act has a creator and updater.
  
## 2.4 Dependent US
- The [US104](US104.md) is greatly dependent on the present US.
- The way [US104](US104.md) accesses the information is closely related to the way this US is implemented.
- The [US106](../sp2/US106.md) user story talks about updating an existent family relation. This functionality is already covered by this US.
